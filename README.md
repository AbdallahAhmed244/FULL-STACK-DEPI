## 🌍 What is FoodBridge?

**FoodBridge** is an enterprise-grade digital platform engineered to address two pressing humanitarian and environmental crises in Egypt: **massive food waste** and **food insecurity**.

### 🛑 The Problem in Egypt
* **Extreme Food Waste**: Restaurants, luxury hotels, bakeries, catering enterprises, and corporate events across Egyptian cities produce hundreds of tons of fresh, edible, high-quality surplus food daily that goes unconsumed and is discarded into landfills.
* **Environmental Impact**: Decomposing food surplus in landfills generates enormous volumes of methane gas, heavily accelerating greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation.
* **Charity Resource Gap**: Legitimate charitable foundations, food banks, refugee shelters, and orphanages struggle with logistical coordination, unpredictable food supply, and lack of real-time communication with potential food donors before perishable meals spoil.

### 💡 The Solution
FoodBridge bridges this gap by acting as a secure, real-time coordination ecosystem:
1. **Food Providers (Donors)** list available surplus meals, specify storage requirements, allergens, quantities, and pickup deadlines within seconds.
2. **Verified Charities (Recipients)** explore available donations regionally, reserve meals with a single click under strict concurrency safeguards, and coordinate collection.
3. **Platform Administrators** enforce regulatory oversight, verify official organization licenses, manage platform health via maintenance mode, and monitor full audit trails.

    Admin["System Administrator\n(Platform Operations)"] -->|"Audit, Verify, Moderate & Maintain"| Backend
```

### 1. Food Providers:
* Publish surplus food batches with high-resolution photos, meal categories, portion counts, allergen warnings, and strict pickup deadlines.
* Review incoming reservation requests with the ability to accept or decline with logged reasoning.
* Confirm exact pickup logistics and trigger live SignalR alerts when packages are packaged and ready for collection.
* Track cumulative philanthropic and environmental impact metrics (total kilograms of food rescued from landfills).

### 2. Charities & NGOs:
* Filter active surplus donations by food category, geographic region, and nearest expiry date.
* Submit instant reservation requests guarded by database-level optimistic concurrency (preventing double-booking).
* Receive real-time push alerts at every step: acceptance, pickup confirmation, and completion.
* Complete mutual partner evaluations and leave authenticated reviews.

### 3. System Administrators:
* Review pending provider and charity legal documentation; approve accounts or reject and suspend fraudulent entities with audit logging.
* Moderate public listings, partner reviews, and reported pickup disputes.
* Toggle the **Platform Maintenance Mode** in real time, automatically evicting active non-admin sessions via SignalR WebSockets.
* Inspect immutable audit log records tracking all administrative actions with timestamps and operator IDs.

## 🏛 Clean Architecture Solution Structure

The project strictly follows Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture pattern, decoupling business rules from UI, database, and third-party frameworks:

## 🌟 Key Enterprise Features

### 1. Real-Time Mutual Review System:
* Charities review Providers and Providers review Charities strictly upon reservation completion.
* Database unique index on `(ReservationId, ReviewerId)` mathematically guarantees **1 review per party per completed reservation**, preventing review bombing or fraudulent ratings.

### 2. Automated Donation Life-Cycle & Self-Healing:
* If a charity cancels an accepted reservation prior to the pickup deadline, the food listing status automatically reverts to `Available`, allowing other nearby charities to rescue the food before it spoils.

### 3. Strict Verification & Audit Compliance:
* Food providers and charities must undergo administrative verification before publishing listings or submitting reservation requests.
* Administrative rejections automatically transition the user account to `Suspended` and record an immutable entry into the `AuditLog` table with the exact reason and operator identity.

### 4. Calculated Platform Impact Metrics:
* Platform-wide rescued food metrics (kg of food redistributed, meal equivalents, carbon offset) are computed exclusively from **completed donations**, strictly filtering out cancelled, rejected, or expired listings.

## 🗺 Interactive Egypt Coverage Map

The landing page features a dedicated interactive geospatial module built with **Leaflet.js** highlighting FoodBridge's operational coverage across 7 strategic hubs in Egypt:

| Operational Hub | Geographic Scope | Hub Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Greater Cairo & Giza Hub** | Cairo, Giza, 6th of October, New Cairo | High-density hotel and restaurant surplus redistribution |
| **Alexandria & North Coast Hub** | Alexandria, Borg El Arab, Northern Coast | Coastal restaurants, resorts, and local food banks |
| **Nile Delta Agricultural Hub** | Tanta, Mansoura, Zagazig, Menoufia | Bakeries, food producers, and rural charity networks |
| **Suez Canal Strategic Hub** | Port Said, Ismailia, Suez | Port facilities, catering services, and community shelters |
| **North & Central Upper Egypt** | Beni Suef, Minya, Asyut | Community kitchens and agricultural surplus relief |
| **Red Sea Resorts Hub** | Hurghada, El Gouna, Sharm El-Sheikh | Large-scale hospitality surplus coordination |
| **South Upper Egypt Hub** | Luxor, Aswan, Qena | Tourism hospitality partners and remote family assistance |

* **Interactive Features**: Clicking any hub card triggers an animated camera transition (`map.flyTo`) directly to the selected hub with a custom animated pin and popup.
* **Theme-Aware Tiles**: Automatically swaps between **Alidade Smooth** (Light Mode) and **Dark Matter** (Dark Mode) map tiles based on the active user theme.
* **Regional Filter Pills**: One-click filtering between Greater Cairo, Alexandria, Delta, Canal, and Upper Egypt.

## 🔒 Real-Time System Maintenance Mode

FoodBridge includes an enterprise maintenance mode for planned system updates, database migrations, and operational maintenance:

* **Live WebSocket Broadcast**: When an administrator activates maintenance mode, SignalR pushes an instant notification to all connected clients.
* **Automatic Session Eviction**: Active sessions for Providers and Charities are immediately terminated and redirected to the branded Maintenance Screen without requiring a page refresh.
* **Guarded Authentication**: Non-administrative sign-in attempts are rejected with localized messages informing users of ongoing system upgrades.
* **Admin Bypass & Banner**: Administrators retain full access to test, verify, and monitor the platform, complete with a persistent top banner indicating active maintenance status.
* **Instant Platform Unlock**: Once maintenance is deactivated, the platform unlocks instantly for all users.
